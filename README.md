# IIT Schedule Generator

[See the schedule generator in action here](https://camero2734.github.io/iitschedulegen/)

## Purpose
Born from the frustration of trying to find the "perfect" class schedule, I created this tool for IIT students to plan their schedules for the upcoming semester, without the hassle of manually managing conflicts or wondering what combination of classes is ideal for them!

## Usage
1. [Open up the webpage here](https://camero2734.github.io/iitschedulegen/)

2. Type in the classes you want to take into the search bar at the top

3. Your possible schedules will now appear in the calendar!

4. Use the `<` `>` buttons to navigate forward and backward through the schedules.

5. Looking for a specific time or day to be free? Click the `Filter/Sort` button to be greeted by time and day constraints!

In this example, the generator will now only list schedules with classes that start no earlier than 9AM and no later than 7:30 PM.

6. Want more info about a class? Simply click on one of the classes on the calendar to get more details!
